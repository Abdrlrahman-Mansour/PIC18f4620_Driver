# PIC18F4620 MCU Implementation

---

### Overview


###### This project demonstrates the implementation of various peripherals and modules using the PIC18F4620 microcontroller. The project is organized into two main layers: the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) Layer and the MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer). Each layer contains multiple modules that provide functionality for different hardware components and communication protocols.
